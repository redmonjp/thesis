Starting AC-procedure:
Adding edge #1 which is - '(1,2)'
0 1 0 1 
0 0 1 1 
0 1 0 1 
1 1 1 0 
The new aggregate set of maximal cliques when adding in the edge {1,2} results in - 
{1,2,4}
{2,3,4}

Adding edge #2 which is - '(1,3)'
0 0 1 1 
0 0 1 1 
0 1 0 1 
1 1 1 0 
The new aggregate set of maximal cliques when adding in the edge {1,3} results in - 
{1,3,4}
{2,3,4}
