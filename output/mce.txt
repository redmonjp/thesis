Adjacency matrix for the graph input: 
0 0 0 1 
0 0 1 1 
0 1 0 1 
1 1 1 0 

Set of primal edges for the graph data input: 
{1,4}
{2,3}
{2,4}
{3,4}

Set of cliques as they appear in the input file: 
{1,4}
{2,3,4}

Clique comparison (bk-algorithm): 
{1,4}
{2,3,4}

The bk_algorithm has returned that the set of maximal cliques provided is correct for this graph.
