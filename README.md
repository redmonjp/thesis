# thesis
This project is the basis for my Masters Thesis at SUNY Polytechnic.
So far the work surrounds Maximal Clique Enumeration (MCE) in  undirected graphs:
  - An implementation of the Bron-Kerbosh (BK) Algorithm for finding the set of all maximal cliques in a given unperturbed graph
  - An implementation of the AC and RC Algorithms from Cavallo and Klir 
  
Further work includes 
  - An implementation of adding an edge from Hendrix 
  - An implementation of removing an edge from Hendrix 
  
My goals for this project are to display and understand the efficiency and complexity of each of these algorithms
